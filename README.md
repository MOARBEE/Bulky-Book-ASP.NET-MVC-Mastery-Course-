This repository contains the Bulky Book e-commerce platform, a comprehensive web application developed as part of the “Complete Guide to ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET6)” course on Udemy, instructed by Bhrugen Patel. The project exemplifies a real-world e-commerce application utilizing the robust capabilities of ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and ASP.NET Core Identity.

Technologies Used

        •       ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 6): Used for building the web application with a Model-View-Controller architecture.
        •       Entity Framework Core: Employed for ORM-based data access, leveraging code-first migrations to manage the database schema.
        •       ASP.NET Core Identity: Integrated for authentication and authorization, enhancing security with role-based access control.
        •       Stripe API: Implemented for processing payments, offering a seamless checkout experience.
        •       Bootstrap 5: Styled the front-end, ensuring a responsive and mobile-friendly user interface.
        •       Microsoft Azure: The final deployment platform, demonstrating cloud hosting capabilities.

Key Learnings

        •       MVC Architecture: Gained in-depth understanding of controllers, views, and models within ASP.NET Core.
        •       Security Practices: Learned the implementation of secure user authentication and authorization.
        •       Database Management: Enhanced skills in database operations using Entity Framework Core, focusing on migrations and database seeding.
        •       API Integration: Developed proficiency in integrating third-party APIs like Stripe for payment processing.
        •       Deployment: Acquired practical experience in deploying web applications to Azure, understanding cloud services and environment configuration.
